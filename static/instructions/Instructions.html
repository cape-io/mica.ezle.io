      <h2>Initial Login and Profile setup</h2>

      <p>Graduates will receive an email directing them to a page that will look like this: </p>

      </figure>

      <p>The field excepts only their @mica.edu email address. Emails will be confirmed against a master list of students showing in the spring. If your email is typed correctly and on that list you will be automatically shown this:</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Which should then automatically generate this:</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="step1.2.png" alt="">
      </figure>

      <p>You will then receive an email to your @mica.edu address.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="step1.3.png" alt="">
      </figure>

      <p>Following the link in the email confirms that you are yourself, and then takes you to the content creation section.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="step2.0.png" alt="">
      </figure>

      <p>Initially all your fields should probably register “empty.” Simply click on any of the “empty” lines to trigger an input form for that piece of information. You can type directly in the field and hit either return or the green checkbox to “save” that entry.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="step2.1.png" alt="">
      </figure>

      <p>Program and Exhibition Location should trigger popup select lists, please select something from the list and hit return or click the green checkbox.</p>

        <img src="step2.3.png" alt="">
      </figure>

      <p>We need a profile image for each graduate student. By default we can pull in your avatar associated with your @mica.edu email on http://en.gravatar.com/ —&nbsp;we can also pull in profile images from your Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram accounts if you provide your name/handle in those places. You will then be able to select any of those 4 profile images from the profile image picker. Alternately, you can paste the url of any image online into the text box provided there as well (please only use images that you have the rights to use and that are representative of you).</p>

      <figure>

      <p>This is all that is necessary by the December 8th launch date.</p>
