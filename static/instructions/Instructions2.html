<h1>Grad Show Backend Instructions</h1>

<h2>Initial Login and Profile setup</h2>

<p>Graduates will receive an email directing them to a page that will look like this: </p>

<figure>
<img src="step1.0.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The field excepts only their @mica.edu email address. Emails will be confirmed against a master list of students showing in the spring. If your email is typed correctly and on that list you will be automatically shown this:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Which should then automatically generate this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="step1.2.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>You will then receive an email to your @mica.edu address.</p>

<figure>
<img src="step1.3.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Following the link in the email confirms that you are yourself, and then takes you to the content creation section.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Initially all your fields should probably register “empty.” Simply click on any of the “empty” lines to trigger an input form for that piece of information. You can type directly in the field and hit either return or the green checkbox to “save” that entry.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Program and Exhibition Location should trigger popup select lists, please select something from the list and hit return or click the green checkbox.</p>

<p>We need a profile image for each graduate student. By default we can pull in your avatar associated with your @mica.edu email on http://en.gravatar.com/ —&nbsp;we can also pull in profile images from your Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram accounts if you provide your name/handle in those places. You will then be able to select any of those 4 profile images from the profile image picker. Alternately, you can paste the url of any image online into the text box provided there as well (please only use images that you have the rights to use and that are representative of you).</p>

<p>This is all that is necessary by the December 8th launch date.</p>

<h2>Uploading and Managing Images</h2>

<p>Controlling the images that display on the graduate show website this year is in your hands. Navigate to the “Images” tab in the nab bar to upload, order, edit, or delete your images.</p>

<p>You will initially have no images uploaded. To get started find the images you want to upload on your computer and then drag them onto the gray block that says “Drag JPG or GIF files.”</p>

<p>Alternately you can just click on that block.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images-1.0.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Please only upload JPGs or GIFs here. If you try uploading PDFs, PSDs, TIFFs, etc. you will receive an alert telling you it is not a supported filetype.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images-1.1.1.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Dragging an image (or many images at once) onto the “Drag JPG or GIF files” area will create little thumbnails for each with a completion bar. Images that are done uploading will disappear from that space and appear in an ordered grid below.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images-1.1.0.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>All your uploaded images will appear below the “Drag JPG or GIF files” area now whenever you navigate back to this section. The order your images appear here is the order they will appear on the website in your page’s slideshow —&nbsp;we are working on a clever way for you to reorder them.</p>

<p><img src="images-1.2.png" alt=""></p>

<figure>
<img src="images-1.3.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>To edit the data associated with each image (title, dimensions, etc.) click on an image thumbnail in the lower grid. This will open a new section at the top of the page where each image’s data can be edited.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images-1.4.0.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Fields do not have to be filled in. You can leave whichever ones you desire blank.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images-1.4.1.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The size requirement allows for no size, variable, as well as specific dimensions. Choosing specific dimensions will open a 3 section form with height, width and depth fields. You do not have to enter a number into the depth field. Please only uses inches here.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images-1.4.2.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>You can add or remove these at your leisure.</p>

<h2>Video/Audio</h2>

<p>Some students may have video or audio components they wish to include. To make this manageable video or audio needs to be hosted on an outside service. Please create your own Youtube, Vimeo, or Soundcloud account for hosting your work.</p>

<p>To add a new video/audio work navigate to the Video/Audio tab in the menu.</p>

<p>You should see a simple form with 1 field — “media link.” Click the “empty” link.</p>

<figure>
<img src="v-a-t-1.1.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>This should open a simple text field.</p>

<figure>
<img src="v-a-t-1.2.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Navigate to the vimeo, youtube, or soundcloud page for the specific video or audio file. Copy the entire url from your browser.</p>

<p><img src="v-a-t-1.3.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="v-a-t-1.6-youtube.png" alt=""></p>

<figure>
<img src="v-a-t-1.6-soundcloud.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Navigate back to the MICA Grad Show page and paste the link you copied into that text field. Hit return or click the green checkbox to save that link.</p>

<figure>
<img src="v-a-t-1.4.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>You should now see an embedded version of the video or audio that you selected.</p>

<figure>
<img src="v-a-t-1.5.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>There is a “more” link —&nbsp;click this to add as many more video/audio links as required.</p>

<p>You can add or remove these at your leisure.</p>
